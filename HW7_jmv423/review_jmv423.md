![Jordan Vani's plot](plot_jmv423.png)

A few critiques of this plot. First I do not think the grey tiled background is necessary in this plot. A plain white background would have sufficed to convey the same idea. Secondly, I do not think the placement of the legend was optimal as it seems to cut off the bar graph showing the Great Recession. Which leads me to my other critique. Correlation does not show causation. This visualization seems to be reaching for causation which is not correct. The addition of the events of economic turmoil does not add any meaningful value towards the comparison of the winning times through the history of the Kentucky Derby. Sure they happen at roundabout the same time but I do not think that you could predict that there would be a Triple Crown winner if it happened to be at the same time as a period of economic upheaval.
