The null and the alternate hypothesis have been stated very clearly and the variables needed to test the hypothesis â€“ date or days of the week and number of passes bought are also clearly tabulated.  An appropriate test to test the hypothesis would be the T test which will look at the differences between the number of 24 hour passes which is a dependent variable, bought on the weekend and the number of passes bought on the weekdays.
