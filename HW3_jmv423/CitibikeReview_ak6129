a. Null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis are formulated correctly.  

b. Data that supports the project has appropriate features: date of purchase and 24-hour passes purchased. 
The given data was pre-processed and extracted ptoperly.    

c. In my opinion, in order to test null hypothesis it is appropriate to chose t-test. 
T-test compares whether two groups (weekends and weekdays) have different average values (number of 24-hours passes purchased). 
This test will help to determine if null hypothesis have to be rejected or not.
