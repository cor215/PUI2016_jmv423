### Clarity
1. The plot is clear & easy to read, colors are uniquely identifiable. 
2. Add plot lines to the legend. 
3. Using similar colors for the plot lines and bars would intuitively tie the two together.
4. Y-axis could be enlarged to better show the first two bars.
5. Y-axis label should read 'Values.'
6. Include horizontal gridlines to better allow the reader to estimate the values. 
7. Include a caption to summarize the figure and any interpretation.

### Aesthetic
1. Simple aesthetic conveys all necessary information without distraction.
2. Good legend placement.
3. As above, using a similar line and bar color could intuitively tie both together.
4. Using a horizontal bar plot could allow you to extend the 'Values' axis to better show the first couple bars.
5. Using thinner bars would further limit whitespace.

### Honesty
Very honest figure with no tricks.

### Conclusion
Simple plot that successfully conveys the mathematical relationship between numbers and their squares & cubes. Only a few minor changes, as listed above, seem worthwhile.

Hooray
